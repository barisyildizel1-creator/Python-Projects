This repository contains my Python learning projects.

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This is a collection of various Python programs and scripts I've created while learning and practicing Python programming.A simple Python program that can encrypt text to Morse code and decrypt Morse code back to text.



## 📁 Projects## Features



### [Mors-Code-Translator](./Mors-Code-Translator/)- **Text to Morse Code**: Convert any text message to Morse code

A simple Python program that can encrypt text to Morse code and decrypt Morse code back to text.- **Morse Code to Text**: Decode Morse code back to readable text

- **Support for**: Letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and common punctuation marks

**Features:**- **Error handling**: Warns about unsupported characters

- Text to Morse Code conversion

- Morse Code to Text conversion## How to Use

- Support for letters, numbers, and common punctuation

- Error handling for unsupported characters1. Run the program:

   ```bash

**How to run:**   python "Mors Code Translator.py"

```bash   ```

cd Mors-Code-Translator

python "Mors Code Translator.py"2. Enter your message when prompted

```

3. Choose your operation:

## 🚀 Getting Started   - Type `1` to encrypt text to Morse code

   - Type `2` to decrypt Morse code to text

Each project is contained in its own folder with:

- Source code files## Supported Characters

- Individual README with specific instructions

- Any additional resources needed- **Letters**: A-Z (case insensitive)

- **Numbers**: 0-9

To run any project:- **Punctuation**: Comma (,), Period (.), Question mark (?), Slash (/), Hyphen (-), Parentheses ()

1. Navigate to the project folder

2. Follow the instructions in that project's README## Example Usage

3. Run the Python script
